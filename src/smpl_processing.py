# --- Initialization ---
# In a real project, these would be initialized once and passed around

# For simplicity, we initialize them here.

# 1. Initialize the pose generator LLM
# This would load a large pre-trained model.

# 2. Initialize the SMPL-X model layer
# This would load the official SMPL-X model file (e.g., .pkl)
