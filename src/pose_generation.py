    (Placeholder)
    This class mocks a multimodal LLM (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini) that
    is fine-tuned or prompted to generate SMPLX pose sequences.
    
    In a real implementation, this would involve:
    1.  An API call to a model like Gemini.
    2.  Or, running a local model like LLaVA or a specialized
        pose-generation transformer.
    3.  The model would take an image and/or a text prompt.
    4.  It would output a sequence of pose parameters in the SMPLX format.
