    This function differentiably renders the MPM simulation output (particles
    or mesh) into a video.
    
    1.  Set up a differentiable renderer (e.g., nvdiffrast, PyTorch3D,
        or a custom differentiable particle renderer).
    2.  Place a camera in the scene.
    3.  If the input is particles, it might render them as splats.
    4.  If the input is a mesh (reconstructed from particles), it
        uses a standard mesh rasterizer.
    5.  The rendering MUST be differentiable w.r.t. the
        `simulation_output` (particle/vertex positions).
        
    Args:
        simulation_output (torch.Tensor): Particle or vertex positions.
                                          Shape: (num_frames, num_points, 3)
        num_frames (int): Number of frames to render.
        height (int): Video height.
        width (int): Video width.
        
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The rendered video.
                      Shape: (1, num_frames, 3, height, width)
                      Values should be in [0, 1] range.
